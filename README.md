# World Weather Analysis
# Overview
The goal of the World Weather Analysis was to gather date from different countries around the world. This data includes the countries latitude and longitude coordinates, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and a current description of the city's weather. We then used the cities gathered in the analysis to determine vacation criteria for users of an app. This app allows users to input their ideal temperature range and the results will show all of the cities around the world that meet their specifications, as shown below.

This analysis was taken a step further and we created a potential travel itinerary for the app user. Taking four cities from a specific county, Indonesia in my analysis, we were able to create a route for the user depending on whether they choose to drive, walk, or bike around the country. An axample of the travel itinerary generated in the analysis can be seen in the image below.

This analysis can be run to help any user plan their dream vacation based on weather parameters of their choosing, helping them decide where in the world may fit their needs best!
